# Part-of-Speech-POS-Tagging

A sentence in English is a combination of words in form of Parts of Speech such as Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Conjunctions, Prepositions, etc.​The same word can either be used as an adjective or a verb. Hence, understanding the correct part of speech is essential for a proper sentence structure.​

​Our project aims to develop a machine learning model that identifies the correct part of speech for each word in the English language, accounting for words that can vary in their part of speech.​
